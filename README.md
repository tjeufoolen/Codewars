## Introduction

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata). These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.
